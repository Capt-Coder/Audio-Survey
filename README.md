# Audio-Based Survey System
The Audio-Based Survey System is a web application that enables users to submit survey responses using voice recognition technology. This project utilizes Flask for the backend, Python for emotion recognition, and a front-end created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can record or upload audio responses for each survey question, and the system provides the survey owner with tools to analyze responses based on emotion and view various statistics.

## Features
- Voice Recognition: Users can record or upload audio responses for survey questions.
- Emotion Recognition: Python is employed to analyze voices and determine the emotional content of responses.
- Statistical Analysis: Survey owners can view different statistics based on the emotional content of the responses.
